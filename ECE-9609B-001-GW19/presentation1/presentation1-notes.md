# All About Traceroute

## Overview

### History

Traceroute is a tool originally written by [Van
Jacobson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jacobson) based, he says, on
an idea he heard from [Steve Deering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Deering). Some of Van's original notes about his implementation in 1987 are
preserved as comments in the the source code of various free software
operating systems that ship with his code, e.g. [`traceroute.c`
in OpenBSD](https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/src/usr.sbin/traceroute/traceroute.c?rev=1.159&content-type=text/plain).
