Really basic traceroute in python:
  https://dnaeon.github.io/traceroute-in-python/

We want:
  to be able to specify a set of source addresses
  to send probes for a large number of addresses
  to send over IPv4 or IPv6, depending on the address provided
  to send a configurable number of probes with each TTL
  to send probes with all values up to some specified maximum TTL
  to specify the sending rate
  to be able to interrupt and restart the sending process
